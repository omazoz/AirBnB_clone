# Awesome AirBnB Clone Console

Welcome to the Awesome AirBnB Clone Console repository!

This repository is part of a fantastic student project aimed at creating a clone of the popular AirBnB website. In this stage, we have implemented a powerful backend console that allows you to manage various aspects of your program data. You can create, update, and destroy objects, as well as handle file storage seamlessly. Thanks to a robust system of JSON serialization/deserialization, your data remains persistent between sessions.
